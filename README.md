#Happy Birthday Sohrob

###Why

Twitter's @hackweek was my inspiration to realize this idea that I've been kicking around for months. I also felt like taking a break from my hardware-software home security project for a blank slate and new problems. 

###What 

This site uses the technologies below to create a simple platform for engaging friends to leverage social capital into collective capital. Rather than separately buying our friend many bottles of bourbon, I'm hoping we can band together to acquire for him a greater gift. Besides buying Sohrob a new mattress, which he desperately needs, this site has allowed me to try my hand at a few new skills or get more familiar with previously learned ones. 

###How

**Flask** I definitely feel much more familiar with Flask, and find myself seeing uses for it everywhere. While I see problems to surmount everywhere I look, I attempt to step back and remind myself that I can interact with my code through the browser now.
                
**Twitter's API, OAuth** I'm not really making much use of Twitter's API, except for the OAuth sign in, but I hope to change that soon.
                
**Javascript (D3 and AJAX)** Similarly, I've moved from using D3 to just using Bootstrap's built in progress bar for visualizing the funding progress. I had originally planned on D3 being the center piece of this site, but I found that I wasn't delivering the information clearly enough. Looking at my to do list, besides smoothing out some UI edges, D3 is my upcoming focus.

**Stripe's API** Wonderfully easy to use.

**SQLAlchemy and Postgresql** I'm using the database as a spreadsheet and I realize that my interaction with the database must be crude and simplistic. I'm hoping that friends will read my code and be able to pull me out of Flatland.

**S3** I've barely scratched the surface of S3/Boto, let alone the rest of the Amazon offerings. I'm happy that I can read documentation well enough to pick up libraries quickly, but I still want to find time to interact with S3 and the Twitter API without libraries.

###To do

-Use Javascript to submit forms.

-D3 instead of Bootstrap for funding plot.

-Display Stripe's cut in an effort to raise the amount pledged.

-Logging

-Javascript countdown to funding deadline.

-Better CSS, less inline. 

-A drawer to hide the voting choices.

-Properly handle multiple rows of pledges. Less bitbanging.
